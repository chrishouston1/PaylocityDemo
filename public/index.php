            <p>This website was created as a web application coding challenge for Paylocity. This application will demonstrate the calculation a company makes for paying for their employees' benefits package.
            </p>
            <h4>Requirements:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The cost of benefits is $1000/ear for each employee.</li>
                <li>Each dependent (children and possibly spouse) incurs a cost of $500/year.</li>
                <li>Anyone whose name starts with 'A' gets a 10% discount, employee or dependent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Assumptions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>All employees are paid $2000 per paycheck before deductions.</li>
                <li>There are 26 paychecks in a year.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To get started, add a few employees (or select from the existing ones), then go to the Calculate page. From there, the application will give you a preview of the costs for the benefits package for the employee and from the requirements above.
